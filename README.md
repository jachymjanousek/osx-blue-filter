## Setup Blue Filter

1. On your Mac, choose Apple menu > System Preferences, click Accessibility, click Display, then click Color Filters.

2. Select Enable Color Filters.

3. Click the ‚ÄúFilter type‚Äù pop-up menu, then choose **Color Tint**, which applies a tint to the entire screen.

4. Click on box with color tint inside. 

5. In color picker dialog, select "RGB Sliders" from pop-up menu.

6. Set values as desired. I prefer levae little bit of green, as I need better color distinction on code highlight in IDE. 

My RGB values are:
- Red: 255
- Green: 64
- Blue: 0

Close the color picer dialog and now you are ready to use this "App" as shortcut to toggle blue light filter

## Disclaimer

This script only enable/disable Color filter. It does not set the value of color that will be applied.
Maybe I will implement this in futuer, but for now, you have to set this up manually.

With new OSX versions it's possible that script will stop working. 

When the script is runnig do not click! You have to wait, until the script finish the action. If you click during the process, the script will fail and throw an error. Just close it and run again.
